<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> has been with some hesitation
that I have undertaken
to write a manual on the
decoration of pottery under
the glaze. This feeling was
caused by the fear that I should not be able
to treat the subject in as comprehensive, as well
as comprehensible, a manner as it deserved.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in an experience of more than
two years, chiefly spent in experimenting on different
methods of under-glaze decoration, I
have learned some things which may be of use
to others, and have thought that a treatise upon
the subject from an unprofessional, yet practical
standpoint, might have its place in the literature
of ceramics which has now become so extensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>Let it be understood, however, that in the
following pages there has been no attempt to
deal with the occult mysteries of the potter’s
art, but simply to give an account of results
attained and facts acquired, every one of which
can be vouched for as a record of actual experience.</p>

<p>I would like here to express my sense of indebtedness
to the potters who have, by their
courtesy and attention, contributed to these results,
and particularly to Mr. Joseph Bailey,
Sr., of the pottery of Mr. Frederick Dallas,
whose intelligent co-operation and valuable advice
have been of the greatest service.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> decoration of pottery
under the glaze offers opportunity
for the production
of work, beautiful and artistic
in a high degree, and
in its simpler forms gives
to those who do not aspire
to the higher art, a most fascinating and labor-rewarding
study. I can not, however, assure those
who wish to enter the domain of decorative art
by this interesting road, that they will find the
way strewn with roses. On the contrary, discouragements
are likely to occur so frequently
that it is only by the exercise of a considerable
amount of patience and perseverance that any
advance can be made. But such are the attractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of the work that its enthusiastic votaries
will not be deterred from its prosecution by any
difficulties in the way, and if immediate and
perfect success can not be assured, an exceedingly
interesting occupation will be revealed to
the learner, and to the earnest worker can be
promised the reward of faithful labor.</p>

<p>I would like here to insist, however, upon the
necessity of a thorough and serious study of
drawing as a preparation for this as well as for
all decorative work, and to enter a most emphatic
protest against the theory which seems to
prevail in some quarters, that any one can paint
upon pottery acceptably. With little preparation
other than the possession of some colors,
brushes, clays, and pieces of pottery, the devotee
of art enters upon the work of decorating (?)
pottery. Alas! disfiguring it, for it is a lamentable
fact that of the pottery now being painted
by amateurs (some of the work by professional
decorators might also be included) a very large
proportion has its value diminished rather than
enhanced by the work put upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span></p>

<p>This would not be so frequently the case if
the scope of the work were limited to the capacity
of the worker. We see every day, attempts,
in which the failure to reach the point aimed at
is absurdly obvious, where, if the effort had been
less ambitious in its aim, the result would not
only be less an object of ridicule, but of far more
intrinsic value.</p>

<p>In other departments of human handiwork,
some natural capacity, as well as a certain amount
of training, is considered necessary to successful
practice, but, in art, such is the ignorance of
the general public, any one is thought eligible
to the profession of an artist, and much passes
under the name of art, which has no claim to
that honorable title.</p>

<p>I do not wish to discourage those who are
willing to enter into this pursuit as humble, patient
learners, but to warn those, who are eager
to obtain at once the rewards only given to years
of faithful study, of the futility of their desires.
It is perhaps idle, however, to warn or to advise
them. The consciousness of their folly will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
only come to them after experience, and knowledge
gained from failure, shall have given them
some comprehension of the difficulties which
their ignorance prevented them from seeing.</p>

<p>In art, as in all other pursuits, there is no
royal road to excellence, and those who do not
think it necessary to learn the rudiments before
attempting the higher branches, will learn to
their cost, if they are capable of learning any
thing, that nothing was gained by leaving out
these stepping stones in their progress.</p>

<p>The time is never misspent which is devoted
to honest, well-directed efforts in acquiring the
art of drawing. The excuse so often offered,
that the practice of the art is only intended as
an amusement, and that therefore it is unnecessary
to undergo the drudgery of learning it
thoroughly, is one which is unworthy. To those
who offer it I would say, pray amuse yourselves
with something else rather than an art, into
which, to obtain even an insight, demands the
best that any one can give.</p>

<p>These remarks apply as well to the decoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
of pottery as to any other department of art
work. Although from its peculiar nature and
various uses this material yields itself to many
and varied styles of decoration, yet this decoration,
however simple, must be planned and executed
according to sound principles, to be of any
artistic value. The best preparation for the
work of decorating pottery, therefore, is a thorough
knowledge of drawing and an understanding
of the laws which govern all decorative art.</p>

<p>Sources of information upon these subjects,
drawn from competent instruction, books and
periodicals, are daily becoming more numerous
and accessible, and one who desires to practice
the kind of decorative art we are now considering,
should cultivate his taste and augment his
skill by these means, and especially by close
study of nature in all its various forms. It is
only in this way that the student will be enabled
to accomplish work which will be a source of
pleasure and profit to himself and others.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> will consider in this chapter
some facts in regard to
pottery, which, although of
a very elementary character,
are not so generally understood
as may be desirable.
These facts relate to the
substances of which pottery is composed, the
processes of its manufacture, and the methods
by which it is or can be decorated.</p>

<p>Two chemical substances, viz., silica and alumina
form the basis of all pottery clays. These
substances are themselves infusible (except under
the compound blow-pipe), but by admixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
with other materials more susceptible to
the action of heat, they are made useful to the
potter’s art, and, when subjected to a high temperature,
fuse and form the hard, insoluable
combination with which we are all familiar.</p>

<p>Porcelain, and the finer kinds of earthen-ware,
are made from clays artificially combined of various
natural elements, in such a manner as to
produce the qualities desired, while the coarser
wares are generally made from clays in a natural
or unmixed state. These clays agree in their
essential characteristics, but contain other elements
which cause certain differences of color,
susceptibility to heat, plasticity, etc. The differences,
therefore, which exist between the many
kinds of pottery manufactured, may be said to
be due, not so much to a diversity of the materials
used, as to the changes produced by the
combination of the same materials in varying
proportions.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary that we should here enter
into the details of the mixture of different pottery
clays, for which each manufactory has its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
own formula. A few words, indicating, in a
general way, the causes of certain easily-recognizable
qualities, will suffice.</p>

<p>The peculiar beauty and translucency of fine
porcelain, is due to an excess of silica, or the
vitreous element of pottery, in its composition.
This is attained by the use of kaolin, a fine,
white clay, produced through the agency of natural
causes in the decomposition of feldspar,
which is itself a silicate of alumina, and one of
the principal ingredients of granitic rocks. In
porcelain, it may be said, that the proportion
of silica to alumina is about three to one, and
the other ingredients, such as iron, potash, chalk,
and soda, exist only in such quantities as are
necessary to cause the fusion of the two first-mentioned
elements. It is fired but slightly the
first time. This leaves the body of the ware
very soft and porous, and upon the application
of the glaze the latter is absorbed into the body,
and by its action upon the materials composing
it, produces a translucent effect.</p>

<p>We refer, here, to French porcelain. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
manufacture of English china, the process is
radically different. The last-mentioned ware is
sometime spoken of as “bone china.” This
term has reference to the use of bones from
which the lime required in its manufacture is obtained.
This element produces a translucent
quality in the body of the ware independently
of the action of the glaze, which in this case
forms merely a coating upon the surface of the
previously hard baked body.</p>

<p>Earthenware possesses less of the vitreous
element, and the first firing is continued until
the ware becomes so dense that it will not absorb
the glaze, and the body remains opaque.</p>

<p>The term pottery, is more strictly applicable
to the kind of ware last mentioned. It is to
this that especial reference will be made in
the following pages, in describing methods of
manufacture and decoration.</p>

<p>Earthenware is of various colors, ranging
from pure white, through the cream white
and cream-colored wares to decided yellow, and
lastly red. The clays can also be artificially
colored, and changes in color are also produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
by different degrees of temperature in
firing. Ordinarily the process of firing produces
a material change in the color of clay.
Thus, a grey-tinted clay will assume a bright,
yellow color, and a dull brown, green, or blue
will be changed to a bright brick-red, under the
action of the fire.</p>

<p>The heat used in firing should produce partial
vitrification. If a piece of ware has not been
fired sufficiently to produce that effect, it is said
to be “soft-baked.”</p>

<p>White earthenware requires the greatest degree
of heat in firing. In regard to the wares made
from clays retaining the colors produced by the
elements which they contain, in a natural state,
it may be said that the amount of heat necessary
for proper firing, decreases with the
depth of color. This rule, although it may
accurately indicate the temperature at which any
given clay should be fired, is simply artificial,
except in so far as the depth of color shows the
presence of an amount of foreign matter, which
by its action increases the fusibility of the clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Red clay, being very susceptible to heat, is
commonly used as a test in the firing of white
ware. The same clay will change in the process
from light red to dark brown, and so enable the
experienced fireman to determine the degree of
heat existing in the kiln.</p>

<p>Clays should be prepared for the making of
pottery by careful sifting, dissolving in water,
and, as a final precaution, straining through sieves
made of fine, silk lawn. In this way all foreign
particles are removed, and the clay, having attained
the consistency of dough, is ready to be
molded into the shapes desired. This is done
in molds made of plaster of paris, or it is
“thrown” by the hands of the potter on a turning-wheel,
or, again, by a combination of these
processes.</p>

<p>Before firing, the ware is said to be in the
“green state,” in which condition it passes from
“wet” to “hard green,” and finally to “white,”
when it is ready to be fired. If fired before
it has become sufficiently dry, it will be liable
to crack, or scale, from the sudden expansion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of the moisture confined in the clay. When
dry, it is placed in “seggars,” or boxes, made
of fire-clay, which are piled upon each other
in a kiln, constructed for the purpose of firing
the ware.</p>

<p>During the process of drying and firing, the
clay loses a certain portion of its bulk. The
amount of this shrinkage varies in different
clays, but ordinarily may be said to be about one-eighth.
A piece of ware, therefore, made from
clay which exhibits this degree of shrinkage,
would be one-eighth smaller after firing than before.
The shrinkage is also modified by the
degree of heat to which the clay has been subjected
in firing, and there will sometimes be a
perceptible difference in the size of two pieces
of ware, made from the same clay, and of equal
size before firing, after having been fired at different
temperatures.</p>

<p>The length of time consumed in firing, varies
with the qualities of the different wares. In the
manufacture of white earthenware, the firing lasts
from thirty to forty hours, while the more common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
kinds of ware require less time. In kilns
of ordinary size, a thousand dozen pieces of ware
are frequently fired at once. Of course, considerable
time is required to place the seggars containing
the ware in the kiln. Some hours must
elapse before the kiln and its contents will become
cool enough to permit its being opened
with safety, so that the firing of hard-baked
pottery may require two or three days for its
completion.</p>

<p>The first firing completed, the ware is said to
be in the “biscuit,” and is then ready to be
glazed. This matter of glazing is a very important
one, and the success of the whole very
largely depends upon the manner in which the
operation is performed. To insure a successful
result there must be the nicest adaptation of the
materials composing the glaze to the body of the
ware. The glaze for each kind of ware must be
suited to its especial characteristics, and it can
therefore be imagined that the number of glazes
in use is very large. Each pottery has its own
glaze and the variety is infinite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The glaze used upon the finer kinds of earthenware
consists of materials similar to those of
which the body of the ware is made, with the
addition of boracic acid (a powerful flux), which
with a little lead renders the glaze fusible. In
the lower grades of ware a larger amount of lead
is used for a flux, and this causes the glaze to
fuse at the comparatively low temperature at
which these wares are fired. A glaze made of
materials that fuse at an unusually low temperature
is called a “soft” glaze. Some glazes
are so soft that, when fired, they can be easily
scratched by the point of a steel instrument.
The glaze of good and durable wares is, however,
so hard, that the point of the sharpest
knife will make no impression on its surface.</p>

<p>The materials of which the glaze is made, are
combined in the proper proportions and diluted to
form a liquid of about the consistency and the
appearance of cream. The piece of ware is then
dipped carefully into the liquid, and so skillfully
manipulated that it is completely covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
a coating of the glaze of the necessary thickness.</p>

<p>After having been covered with the glaze,
which, before firing, has the appearance of an
opaque white paint, the ware is ready for the
second firing. This is done in what is called the
“gloss” kiln, in which the heat is not brought
to such a high degree as in the biscuit kiln, but
is sufficient to fuse the glaze, and cause it to
form a glassy, transparent surface, which should
completely cover the body of the ware, and present
an equally brilliant appearance in every part.</p>

<p>If the glaze is not suited to the body of the
ware, and does not shrink equally with it, its
surface will soon present a network of fine
cracks. A glaze in this condition is said to be
“crazed.” This, among potters, is considered
a serious fault, and in ware intended for cooking
or table use, is certainly very undesirable.</p>

<p>Old Japanese crackle-ware, in which this condition
is a distinguishing feature, is, however,
much esteemed, and many, indeed, the majority
of the Japanese earthernwares, both ancient and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
modern, display a surface of fine-crackled glaze,
which may not be said to detract from their value
as articles of ornament.</p>

<p>A similar effect is also seen in old pieces of
glazed ware which have seen long service as
cooking utensils, in which case it has been the
natural result of the usage to which they have
been subjected.</p>

<p>In some modern wares, both French and English,
decorated under the glaze, this defect is
seen. In these cases it has been caused by the
use of a softer glaze than the body of the ware
demanded. This expedient has been resorted
to in order that the brilliancy and beauty of the
colors might be preserved. These articles being
intended only for ornament, beauty is more of an
object than durability, and this defect of glaze
may be permissible as the means of obtaining
more brilliant effects. In certain methods of
decoration this may be a necessity, but these
cases are exceptional and experience leads me to
believe that it is possible to obtain beauty of coloring
with a glaze which will remain intact. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is to be hoped, however, that with the improvements
in making colors the time may come when
it will be possible to obtain colors which will retain
their beauty under the degree of heat necessary
to the production of an article which a
practical potter would call a perfect piece of
ware.</p>

<p>Pottery can be decorated either <em>under</em> the glaze,
<em>with the glaze</em>, as in the case of majolica, in which
the color is effected by the use of colored glazes
and in the decoration of soft porcelain (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâte-tendre</i>),
where the painting is executed upon the
unbaked glaze, and, lastly, <em>over</em> the glaze.
We will concern ourselves only with the first
of these methods. A few words, however, may
not be out of place here, upon the differences
between over and under glaze painting, which
are frequently compared and as frequently mistaken
for each other.</p>

<p><em>Over</em>-glaze painting, as is well known, is executed
upon the glazed surface of the finished ware
with vitrifiable colors having enough flux or fusible
material in their composition to cause them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
fuse at a comparatively low temperature, and so
become attached to the glaze. <em>Under</em>-glaze decoration
is effected by the use of colors which contain
less flux, and consequently require a higher
temperature for their fusion. It can be executed
either upon the ware in the “green” state, or,
as is more commonly the case, in the biscuit.
These two methods of painting differ materially
in their effects. Any one familiar with these
effects can readily discover whether a piece of
pottery has been decorated over or under the
glaze. Those who are not practically conversant
with the two methods can be easily misled, and
mistakes are frequently made by those who
should know better, as to the method employed
in the case of a piece of ware in question.</p>

<p>A certain delicacy of tint and firmness of
outline characterizes overglaze painting, which is
easily recognized by experts, but those who can
not distinguish between the two methods by this
means may ascertain to which class the decoration
belongs by looking aslant the surface.
The glaze upon the painted portions of a piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of ware decorated over the glaze, will not, even
after the most perfect firing, equal the glaze upon
the uncovered portions in brilliancy, and there
will probably be certain inequalities of surface
between the painted and unpainted parts which
will be revealed to the touch.</p>

<p>If the decoration has been executed under the
glaze the surface will be uniformly covered with
a brilliant glaze. Of the two, underglaze painting
is probably the most difficult, as the colors
are more liable to change under the action of the
great heat to which the ware must be subjected,
and the final results being, therefore, somewhat
uncertain, can not be accurately counted upon,
until experience has been gained from repeated
failures. On the other hand, overglaze painting,
while not subject to the changes produced by the
fire, to so great an extent, is more difficult as
regards the manipulation of the painting upon
the glazed surface. The facilities for the practice
of overglaze painting are greater than those
afforded for painting under the glaze, which last,
requires not only the handling of an artist who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
has acquired facile use of the brush and some experience
of pottery clays and colors, but also the
assistance of an intelligent and skillful potter.</p>

<p>Let us not, however, laud one method of
painting at the expense of the other. Both are
good in their way, and confined within their
proper limits, have beauties peculiarly their own.
Overglaze painting possesses a delicacy of effect
and a variety of color which the underglaze decoration
can not rival. The latter is, however, the
most artistic as well as the most effective, and
lends itself more readily to the uses of decorative
art and to the modern taste in color.</p>

<p>It is this latter method of decorating pottery
which we will now consider in some of its various
forms.</p>

<span class="fs80">COLORS FOR PAINTING UNDER THE GLAZE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i026.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="drop-cap">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Colors</span> for painting
under the glaze are specially
prepared for the
purpose from various
metallic oxyds. As
mentioned in the previous
chapter, the colors
used under the
glaze have less flux or fusible matter in their composition
than those used for painting overglaze:
this is necessary, because in the former the colors
are expected to bear a much greater degree of heat
in firing than in the latter. They are so prepared
as not to fuse except at the temperature required
in the manufacture of the pottery to which they
are applied. The variety of underglaze colors is
less than that to be found in overglaze colors, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the oxyds from which colors may be made which
will stand so great a degree of heat, are few in
number.</p>

<p>The oxyds from which the colors are prepared
are called the bases of these colors. The colors
used in underglaze painting are made from the
following bases:</p>

<p>Blue from the oxyd of cobalt. Co. O.</p>

<p>Green from the sesquioxyd of chromium.
Cr<sup>2</sup>. O<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Browns from the sesquioxyd commonly called
the peroxyd of iron, Fe<sup>2</sup>. O<sup>3</sup>., and from the sesquioxyd
of manganese. Mn<sup>2</sup>. O<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Yellow from the compound of titanium with
oxygen, called titanic acid. Ti. O<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Black from the oxyd of uranium.</p>

<p>Red from the suboxyd, or red oxyd of copper.
Cu<sup>2</sup>. O.</p>

<p>We may add, upon the authority of M. Debette,
that “pure black is obtained by taking 1
part of oxyd of uranium diluted in 22 parts of
glaze; ordinary black with oxyd of manganese
or oxyd of iridium; bluish black with a mixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of oxyd of cobalt and of manganese, and smoky
grey with chloride of platinum. Rose is obtained
by diluting, in glaze, gold which has
been dissolved in aqua regia. For the blues,
oxyd of zinc and alumina may be mixed with the
oxyd of cobalt. For greens may be mixed oxyd
of cobalt and oxyd of chromium.”</p>

<p>The fluxes used for these bases are given in
the following paragraphs, translated from the
<cite>Encyclopédie-Roret</cite>:</p>

<p>“The matters which enter into the composition
of the fluxes and which cause the adherence
of the metallic oxyds are quartz, feldspar, borax
and boracic acid, nitre, the carbonates of potash
and of soda, red lead and litharge, and oxyd of
bismuth. At Sevres, they employ, for under-glaze
painting, seven kinds of fluxes, which suffice
for all the colors. The majority of these
fluxes are composed of quartz, oxyd of red lead
and of boracic acid, and to some is added a small
quantity of carbonate of soda.</p>

<p>“The seven fluxes of Sevres are, first, the
flint flux, which is prepared by melting quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in a crucible and then flowing upon a metallic
plate a mixture of 3 parts of red lead or of
litharge, and 1 part of Etampes sand.</p>

<p>“Second. The flux of greys prepared with 6
parts of red lead or litharge, 2 parts of Etampes
sand, and 1 part of pulverized borax.</p>

<p>“Third. The flux of carmines is made of 1
part red lead, 3 parts of Etampes sand, and 5
parts of pulverized borax.</p>

<p>“Fourth. The flux of purple is made with 3
parts of red lead or of litharge, 1 part of Etampes
sand, and 5 parts of crystallized boracic acid.</p>

<p>“Fifth. The flux of violets is made of 27 parts
of litharge or red lead, 2 parts of Etampes sand,
and 11 parts of crystallized boracic acid.</p>

<p>“Sixth. The flux of greens employed, as well
as the two preceding M. Salvetat, was prepared
by him with 8 1-9 parts of red lead or litharge,
1 part of Etampes sand, and 2 parts of crystallized
boracic acid.</p>

<p>“Seventh. Last the flux of the metallic substances,
which is of sub-nitrate of bismuth, obtained
by decomposing in water the nitrate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the acid of bismuth, to which is added 1-12 of
borax.”</p>

<p>These fluxes are mixed with the basic oxyds in
greater or less proportion, according as the colors
are intended for work, which will require a
greater or less degree of heat in firing.</p>

<p>Underglaze colors in powder suitable for painting
on pottery, can be procured of several different
manufactures. As mentioned before, the
variety of these colors is not so great as is to be
found in overglaze colors, but as they can be
readily mixed the number is sufficient for all
practical purposes.</p>

<p>In my own work I have made almost exclusive
use of French colors, those manufactured by
M. Lacroix. These colors are finely ground and
of considerable variety of tint. A list of those
which have been tried and found to give satisfactory
results, may be given here:</p>

<p>There are many others, but these are mentioned
as among those that have been tried and
found to fire well, and the colors given in this
list will be sufficient for the production of all the
tints needed in underglaze painting. In faience
painted after the Haviland method, fine white
clay takes the place of white.</p>

<p>In painting on the biscuit white paint is sometimes
used. This can be procured of English
manufacture, but is not, I believe, made by M.
Lacroix. The colors manufactured by Messrs.
Hancock &amp; Sons, Worcester, England, are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
very satisfactory. The tints of these and the
colors of other English manufacturers corresponds
with those of M. Lacroix, which have
been mentioned. The latter manufacturer, however,
furnishes a much greater variety of colors,
and the reds especially are superior to any English
reds I have seen. M. Lacroix’s list includes
at least three reds, one of which, <em>Rouge T.</em>, can
be relied upon to produce as good a scarlet as is
possible under the glaze, when used under the
proper conditions. The English carmines are
very satisfactory. The English green, called
French green, corresponds in tint to that of M.
Lacroix, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vert foncé</i>, No. 1, while mazarine
blue, of the Worcester and Phillips manufactures,
and Cobalt blue of others corresponds to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bleu de Roi</i> of the French, and for work on
biscuit white ware stands the fire rather better.
The Victoria green, of the Worcester colors, is
especially to be commended for a light green
which stands the fire remarkably well.</p>

<p>Phillips’ English colors are also very good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
His mazarine blue, especially, is one of the finest
blues I have ever met with. Emery’s and Harrison’s
colors fire very well, but are not so finely
ground as the first mentioned.</p>

<span class="fs80">PAINTING ON POTTERY AFTER THE MANNER OF<br>
THE HAVILAND OR LIMOGES FAIENCE.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i034.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="drop-cap">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> method of painting on
pottery is said to have
been discovered by M.
Laurin, at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourg-la-reine</i>,
in the year 1873. The
process was afterward
adopted by M. Haviland,
and by him improved in such manner as to materially
change the method, as well as the appearance
of the painting. Specimens of the ware
were first exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition,
in Philadelphia, in 1876. The first application
of a similar style in the decoration of pottery, in
this country, was made by the writer in Cincinnati,
in October, 1877.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>This method of decorating pottery, although
not involving the use of any new principle, was
yet so entirely novel an application of principles
already in use, as to entitle M. Laurin to all the
credit attaching to a very original and important
discovery. It places in the hands of the painter
of pottery a method at once so artistic, and so
thoroughly in accord with the modern school, as
to awaken a profound interest in the minds of
all lovers of art. It is probable that there are
capabilities in this art that have not yet been
brought out. It is still in its infancy, and that
there are in it possibilities of much importance
to the artistic world, can hardly be doubted.</p>

<p>If it were not for the technical difficulties which
surround all work on pottery, and this style in
particular, it would offer facilities for the production
of works of art unequaled by any
method heretofore in use. It is the hope of
the writer that the following description of the
method of decorating pottery, in this manner,
may throw some light upon these technical difficulties,
and also that artists of ability may be induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to try it, and so demonstrate the capability
it undoubtedly possesses.</p>

<p>The mere knowledge of the materials used
will, however, no more produce artistic work,
than a box of Winsor &amp; Newton’s colors, in
the hands of a beginner, will enable him to paint
a picture, equal to one by Titian. To produce
good work in this method, there must be a certain
amount of skill at the command of the
painter, just as the same degree of skill is requisite
in the production of a good picture by
any other method. There is a certain boldness
of effect produced by the very nature of the
materials and process, which probably would
not be seen in the work of the same person in
other methods, yet the lack of artistic feeling and
ability will be as painfully apparent in this as in
any other.</p>

<p>Colors may be daubed upon pottery, as they
are, alas! upon canvas, by those whose training
and whose feeling for art would hardly fit them
to become good house painters; but the result
will not be good art, nor will it ever be its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
excuse for being. If other branches of decorative
art require taste, knowledge, and practical
skill, so much the more does this, when it offers
scope for the highest capacity. To the artist of
ability sufficient to make use of it, it furnishes
a palette which, although not of the same range
as that of oil colors, yet affords an almost unlimited
scale of colors, each of which is enhanced
to the fullest degree by the brilliant glaze,
with which the work is finished. The painting
executed with these beautiful colors, moreover,
is practically unchangeable, and none of the ravages
of time, short of the destruction of the
piece of ware itself, can affect it. In decorations
for buildings, or for ordinary use in portraiture,
or the higher forms of art, it offers, what has
long been desired among artists and art lovers, a
method of making works of art indestructible
and beyond the possibility of change.</p>

<p>The ware known among dealers under the
name of “barbotine,” has some resemblance to
that which we have been considering. It has a
light body, which has been subjected to a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
slight fire, and is covered with a soft glaze,
which ensures great brilliancy of coloring. The
ware, however, has no durability, and is a substance
that would not stand the action of the
elements, if used in external decoration.</p>

WITH THE USE OF BODY COLOR.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i039.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="drop-cap">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> method of decorating
pottery here described is
similar in its effects to
what is known as the
Haviland, or Limoges faience,
and is given as the
result of numerous experiments
made by the writer.</p>

<p>The finished work presents the appearance of
a painting in oil, to which a brilliant glaze has
been applied. This glaze not only renders the
colors unchangeable, but gives a beauty and
effectiveness which could be acquired in no other
way. There is nothing peculiar in regard to
this glaze, however, the only requisite being that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
it should be suited to the body of the ware, and
that the latter and its glaze must not require so
great a degree of heat in firing that the colors
shall be injured. This matter of the glaze has
been almost uniformly misrepresented in accounts
of the ware which have been published.
It has been said that the peculiar effect of the
work was due to the glaze, and that the secret
of making it was not generally known. This is
not at all true, as the results are due solely to the
peculiar method of painting, and the glaze is
simply the process by which it is finished, and
bears the same relation to it as the varnish does
to the painting in oil. The work will suffer, of
course, if this part of it is not well performed;
but the distinguishing feature of the method
consists not in the glaze, but in the use of clay,
which is mixed with coloring oxides, capable of
bearing a high degree of heat in firing, and which
gives them body, producing a thick <em>impasto</em> in
the painting. The work partakes, therefore,
both of the nature of painting and modeling, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the high lights may be laid in so thickly as to
produce an actual relief.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult, indeed, almost impossible,
to give a correct idea of the palettes to be
used in this kind of painting. If colors could be
procured, already prepared for use, as oil paints
are, and these colors had the same appearance after
firing as before, it would be comparatively an easy
task. As it is, the colors must be mixed with
clays in certain proportions, and, on account of
the change produced by firing, the proportions
necessary to produce the intensity of color desired,
can only be determined from experience. The
result, after the work is finished, differs from its
appearance before firing to a greater extent than
in any other kind of decoration upon pottery.
As a rule, it may be said that the colors are intensified
by firing. This is also true of other
kinds of under-glaze painting, but not in so
great a degree as in the case in question. The
harmonies and contrasts of color can be kept
only in the mind of the artist, and every part
of the work must be done with a view to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
result when finished, which, as has been said, will
differ materially from its appearance during the
progress of the painting. Experience only, can
give an accurate idea of these changes. This,
however, is not an insurmountable difficulty;
care and patience added to the requisite artistic
ability, will soon lead to satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Before describing the method of painting, it
may be well to consider the kind of clay of
which the body of the ware should be made, and
the state in which the painting should be applied.
As to the clay forming the body of the
ware, it must be of such a nature as to adapt itself
to a glaze sufficiently soft to preserve the
colors. As the clay used in the painting must,
of necessity, in most cases, be white, in order
that the purity and beauty of the colors may not
be affected by admixture with it, a body of the
same, or very nearly resembling it, would, in
some respects, be the best, one reason for this
being that the applied clay would be more certain
to adhere firmly to the body, both having the
same qualities. The proper glaze for such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
body would, however, require too great a degree
of heat in the firing, and none but the strongest
colors could bear it without injury.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, that the glaze may be perfectly
adapted to the body of the ware, and yet
require no greater degree of heat than the colors
used in the painting will bear, it is best to
use a body formed from materials which do not
need to be fired at a very high temperature.
This desired quality is found in some of the
natural colored clays. A mixture partaking of
the qualities of both yellow and red clay, without
the unpleasant color of the former, and possessing
greater strength than the latter, has been
found to be the best.</p>


<h3>THE STATE OF THE WARE IN WHICH THE PAINTING
SHOULD BE APPLIED.</h3>

<p>For this method of decoration the ware
should be in the “green” state. The more
moisture it contains the better, and it will be in
proper condition if procured as soon as it leaves
the hands of the molder, or as soon as it has become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
sufficiently dry to retain its shape. Pieces
can be kept in this state a considerable length
of time, by placing them in a box which has
been lined with plaster of paris. This lining
should be about an inch thick, and if the inside
is occasionally sprinkled with water, it will remain
moist, and keep the clay in good condition.
A box of this kind is really invaluable
for all work, where it is necessary to keep clay
moist. Within certain limits the clay is improved
rather than injured by keeping in this
way; the effect upon it being that it becomes
tougher and more plastic. If kept too long, it
becomes “rotten,” and the plastic quality is
lost, but it will keep a reasonable length of time,
even two or three months. If the box can not
be had, the pieces may be covered by a rubber
cloth, which should be kept from touching
them by a frame of wood or galvanized iron
wire, damp cloths having been placed around
them to produce sufficient moisture.</p>

<p>It is necessary to exercise this care in keeping
the ware moist, in order to prevent the clay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
which is applied to the surface in painting, from
cracking during the process of drying. It must
always be borne in mind that the material made
use of in painting is simply clay, which has been
artificially colored, and, as clay, becomes subject
to the rules which govern all work of this kind,
whether it is making pottery, modeling, or painting
faience.</p>

<p>To produce depth and richness of effect, the
painting should have a heavy <em>impasto</em>, and the
high lights should be laid on in such a manner
as almost to present the appearance of modeling
in relief. When this is done, there is a tendency
in the applied clay to crack in drying, if the conditions
are not right. In applying one piece of
clay to another, it is requisite that both should
be of the same consistency, to ensure equal contraction.
In this case, however, the clay is used
as paint, and must be of such consistency as
will permit its manipulation with the brush. Its
application, then, to a body of clay that has lost
much of its moisture, is attended with some
risk, and the fact that the coating of clay is comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
thin, alone renders it possible to defy
one of the conditions which govern the use of this
material. When the piece of ware, upon which
this painting is applied, has previously become
too dry, the moisture in the coating of clay is
very quickly absorbed into the body, and this
causes it to shrink unequally with the body, and
thus to crack. When the body and the applied
clay are more nearly in the same condition, and
the former still retains considerable moisture, it
does not absorb that of the clay on the surface so
rapidly, and they shrink and dry together.</p>

<p>The drying of the clay used in painting can,
however, be retarded by the use of gum tragacanth,
which may be mixed with it. It would,
perhaps, be better always to take the precaution
to use this medium, although when, as remarked
before, the body of the ware is still quite soft,
and the condition of the atmosphere such as to
prevent too rapid drying, the painting may be
executed simply with the use of water.</p>

<p>Just here a caution as to the use of gum tragacanth
may be given, and that is, that it is better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
not to mix the gum with more of the colored
clay prepared for painting than is to be used at
once. When mixed only with water, the clay
after becoming dry, can be easily rubbed down
again with water; but if gum tragacanth has been
used in the mixture, and it has been allowed to
dry upon the palette, the gum will not re-dissolve
readily under the action of water and the palette
knife, and the mixture will be full of small particles
of undissolved gum, which will render it
unpleasant to work with. To prepare gum tragacanth
for use, it is dissolved in water, to which
may be added a drop of salicylic acid to keep it
from turning sour.</p>

<p>The clay, which is to form a body for the
colors, must be dissolved in water until of a
proper consistency for painting. It should be a
little thicker than the diluted clay used by potters
and technically called “slip.” As to the
quality of the clay, the desideratum is that it
shall be colorless and not inclined to crack in
drying. The clay used in the manufacture of
white granite ware is probably the best clay for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
this purpose, generally accessible. This can
be mixed with all the colors without injury
to the tint of any. Parian clay produces the
most beautiful effects, and, where it is possible
to procure it, forms the best medium for
this painting. More care must, however, be
exercised in its use, as it is very liable to crack
in drying, and from the translucency produced
in the body by the action of the fire, must be
laid on more thickly than clays which have
greater opacity, to produce the effect desired.</p>

<p>In the case of yellow, which does not always
stand the fire well, it is best to mix the color
with a yellow-tinted clay to ensure a successful
result. C. C. clay, which is a cream-tinted
white, will effect this. If a darker yellow is desired,
clay which in firing acquires a decided yellow-tint
may be used.</p>

<p>A light cream-tinted clay, such as C. C., or
“stilt” clay, may be used with yellows therefore,
with advantage, with browns and blues without
disagreeable effects; but in the case of scarlet,
pink, or crimson and greens, nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
white clay must be used, if purity of tint is desired.
The reason for this is that the presence
of iron in the yellow-tinted clays injures the
colors mentioned.</p>

<p>The clay can be procured from the pottery in
broken pieces, or, better, in a semi-pulverized
state from the trimming in making the wares.
When in this state it is easy at any time to dissolve
enough for use. It is, perhaps, better to
prepare it just before it is to be used, as the
longer clay stands, after it has been mixed with
water, the more compact it becomes. When it
has just been dissolved, it still retains air among
its particles, and this renders the mixture more
porous and less liable to crack. It soon dissolves
in water and can be stirred until smooth. It
may be strained through a sponge, alternately
allowing the sponge to absorb the diluted clay
and then squeezing it. Probably the most convenient
way is to rub the clay in a mortar until
all the lumps are dissolved. If a very small
quantity only is needed it may be rubbed down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
upon the palette with the palette knife as it is
wanted.</p>

<p>A palette or a slab of glass may be used for
mixing the colors and clay. The latter is the
best, as it can be procured of large size, and as
in this kind of work a considerable quantity of
paint is necessary, there should be ample room
to mix the colors. A slab of French plate glass,
at least twenty by twenty-four inches, may be
procured. This can be imbedded in plaster of
paris, which will make it stronger, as well as furnish
a white surface upon which the colors will
show to better advantage.</p>

<p>The powdered colors as procured are not perfectly
pulverized, and must be well rubbed down
with a muller and palette knife. It is even more
necessary in this than in other kinds of painting
upon pottery that the color should be well
ground. If not rubbed down sufficiently <em>before
being mixed with the clay</em>, particles of color which
are scarcely apparent before firing, will show
when the work is glazed, forming specks in what
should be, a perfectly uniform tint. If the color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
is mixed with the clay before it has been perfectly
dissolved, it will not afterward be possible by
any rubbing down to remove the specks from the
mixture.</p>

<p>The colors, after being thoroughly ground,
can be mixed with clay in such proportions as
may be desired. The white clay takes the place
of white, and is used to lighten every tint, as
well as to form a body for the colors. It is a
good plan, where experience has rendered it possible
to do it with judgment and certainty of
result, to mix the various tints in water with
clay, in quantities, and then allow them to dry.
When dry, they can be pulverized and the colored
powder can be put away in bottles for future
use. This saves time when painting, and also
ensures a like result from the use of a mixture
which has already been tested and found to be
satisfactory. It is only, however, after considerable
experience in mixing colors, and verifying
their results, that this can be safely done.</p>

<p>As in other kinds of underglaze painting, it
may be given as a general rule, that the colors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
are intensified in firing, in this, however, much
more than in other methods. All the stronger
colors are intensified to a degree difficult to
realize before experience has taught the artist
what to expect. They all become several shades
darker, and, in the case of blues, blacks and
greens, it is more difficult to obtain delicacy,
than depth of tint.</p>

<p>In the use of scarlet, crimson and yellow, a
considerable amount of the color in proportion
to the clay must be used for the darker portions
to give sufficient depth. Only enough clay must
be taken to give body to the paint, and the mixture
should then be applied very thickly. The
painter must also bear in mind the fact that the
stronger color will overpower the weaker in mixtures,
even when the latter is in such degree as
to give the color to the mixture before firing.
After firing, the stronger color will appear in excess.
In making such mixtures, therefore, the
stronger color should be used very sparingly, if
it is desired that the other should predominate
in the tint when fired. Otherwise, the colors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
may be found after firing to be entirely different
from what was intended.</p>


<h3>METHOD OF PAINTING.</h3>

<p>Let us suppose that the artist wishes to paint
a vase. A certain tint being selected for the
ground, the color, or colors, which are to produce
it are mixed in their relative proportions,
according to the hints given above. A sufficient
quantity should be prepared to paint the
whole ground, especially if a mixed tint, which
it would be difficult to reproduce in its exact
proportions. It will require some little experience
to enable the artist to judge how much will
be needed, and, perhaps, it will be somewhat
difficult for any one accustomed to painting in
other methods, to realize the quantity of paint
used in this. It is better to have too much
mixed than too little, as it can be kept and used
another time.</p>

<p>The color, or colors, for the ground having
been rubbed down until perfectly smooth, as
directed before, may be mixed with more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
clay, according to the shade of color desired.
The first tint may be made to represent the
darkest shade in the ground, and a comparatively
small amount of clay should be used. After the
color has been mixed with the clay, it can be
placed on one side of the palette. By taking
portions from it and adding more clay, other
shades of the same color may be made. First,
a light tint may be prepared for the first coat
upon the vase.</p>

<p>Before commencing to lay on the ground, it is
well to wash the surface of the vase with a thin solution
of glaze (such as is used for finishing the
ware), or with borax water. This is to ensure the
adhesion of the clay, of which the painting is to
consist, to the clay of which the vase is made.
Previous to this, the vase, if not already in good
condition, should be washed over with a brush,
or with a sponge dipped in water, or sprinkled
until it has absorbed water enough to keep the
clay, which is to be applied to its surface, from
drying too quickly.</p>

<p>A broad, flat camel’s-hair brush may then be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
charged with the <em>light tint</em>, and the surface of the
vase covered with it as evenly as possible, and so
thickly as to completely obscure the body. This
done, another tint, darker than the first, in a degree
sufficient to permit their being distinguished
from each other, may be mixed. This
will form the middle tint of the ground, and is
to be laid on over the first. The reason for
applying two coats is, that, although it might
be possible to paint one with the degree of
thickness necessary to prevent the shrinkage of
the applied clay in the firing, from revealing the
body of the vase, still the beginner is very likely
to be deceived as to the thickness of the <em>impasto</em>,
judging by the eye alone. Potters dip pieces
of ware in colored slips, and the thickness of
the covering thus formed is all sufficient. In
the case of painting, however, it is impossible
to lay the clay on as evenly, and there will
be, in all probability, some places too thinly
covered to stand the fire, but which would not
be revealed before. It is better, therefore, to
apply two coats, so that one may cover up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the deficiencies of the other. The reason for
having these two coats of different tints is, that
it is then possible to be assured that the surface
is covered completely, it being easy to distinguish
the first tint laid from the body of the
vase, and in the second painting, to observe that
it entirely covers the first.</p>

<p>The second coat finished, a lighter tint should
be mixed, with which the ground is varied by
touches here and there, making the highest
light of the ground, while touches of the first
tint mixed, give the darker shades. There
should be difference enough in tone between the
middle tints of the ground, and these lighter and
darker tints, to produce a good effect of light
and shade, and these touches should be laid on
with a free hand, and then softened into the
ground, care being taken that the lights and
shadows should not end too abruptly.</p>

<p>In these touches, as in all the painting, there
must be a certain thickness in reality, as well as
in appearance, to make the work effective when
finished. The clay shrinks and seems to be dissipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in the process of firing, and if applied
too thinly, in any part, will reveal the body of
the ware, or some under-tint, perhaps spoiling
the appearance of the whole. The transparent
effect, produced by a thin layer of clay, which,
after firing, shows the under-tint through, is
sometimes very beautiful in certain parts of a
design. It is, however, difficult to judge by the
eye of the requisite degree of thickness necessary
to produce this effect, and the heat of the firing
may be so great as to cause that portion of the
painting to disappear entirely. It can not, then,
be safely counted upon, and the best way is to
depend solely upon the lights and shades of the
painting for the effects desired.</p>

<p>The ground finished, the decorative design
may be painted upon it. This should not be
outlined upon the surface, but should simply be
painted with a free hand, and without too much
attention to detail, a brilliant effect of light,
shade, and color being the object aimed at in
this style of painting.</p>

<p>We will suppose that a floral design is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
painted upon the vase. The middle tint of the
flowers can first be laid, the shadows are then
put in, and lastly the high lights, laid on heavily,
almost giving the effect of relief. Leaves and
other accessories of the design may be treated in
the same manner. The edge of the design must
be softened into the background, to avoid a hard
effect after the work is glazed. The process of
glazing has a tendency to soften and melt the
tints into each other, but this effect must be enhanced
by judicious use of the middle tints and
shadows of the painting, and by leaving the
edges thin. One of the greatest beauties of this
kind of painting, when well done, is the effect of
the rich colors melting into each other, with a
charming indistinctness, which leaves something
to the imagination of the beholder.</p>

<p>Those who have not been accustomed to the
use of color in such masses, will, perhaps, be
embarrassed at first by the difficulty of painting
with clay. This will soon be overcome by practice,
but, as has been said before, it should always
be remembered that it is clay which is used,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and, therefore, the work is subject to the conditions
which govern the use of that material.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter further into details, as
it is only intended here, to give some instruction as
to the method of painting, leaving the manner of
it to the artist, it being taken for granted that any
one desiring to practice this kind of painting
should have already attained some proficiency in
the use of colors, and should have acquired a
knowledge of the rules which govern art.</p>

<p>To such there will simply be the difficulty of
learning to work with a new material. If this
knowledge does not exist, it will be no easier to
succeed in accomplishing any thing, worth the
doing, in this, than in other kinds of art work.</p>

<p>With regard to the colors to be used, it is
enough to say that a sufficient number can be
obtained to produce by admixture, in various degrees,
tints for the production of any subject required.
It is only necessary to remember, as
said before, that in these mixtures the stronger
colors must not be in such proportion as to overpower
the weaker. A list of useful colors has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
been given in a previous chapter. In regard to
the mixtures of these colors a few words may be
of use.</p>

<p>Black is a very useful color for shadows, making,
in its admixture with white clay, numerous
pleasing tints of grey, which may be varied by
the addition of any other color which may be desired.
As black is one of the strongest colors,
however, it must be very sparingly used where a
light tint is needed. In the mixture of blue and
green, the former must exist in a much smaller
proportion than the latter, if the mixture is to
have a greenish tint. Experience alone can give
success, but enough has been said to prevent the
beginner from making very disastrous mistakes.</p>

<p>The painting must, of course, be executed
while the clay is wet, and should be finished in
one sitting. If this is not possible, it may be
kept wet in the way described for keeping the
ware before painting.</p>

<p>In describing the method of painting a vase,
we have taken for our model, one decorated with
flowers. Decorations can, however, be as varied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in regard to subjects as paintings on canvas.
Floral decorations seem to be the best adapted
to vases, or other objects having rounded surfaces.
Plaques and vases, such as pilgrim jars,
which afford flat surfaces, may also be decorated
with landscapes or figures. For these subjects
somewhat different treatment may be adopted,
but enough has been said to indicate the requirements
of the material, and each artist will find a
manner suited to himself.</p>

<p>Decorations of a similar character can be produced
upon ware of different colors, leaving the
color of the clay for a ground. This has a very
good effect when done upon cream-tinted clay
in suitable colors. As this kind of ware should
be fired at a higher temperature than the deeper
tinted and coarser clays, the colors are liable to
fade in the firing. This is not undesirable, however,
as the faded tints harmonize with the light
ground much better than darker colors. Some
beautiful effects can be produced by decoration
of this kind, which can be supplemented by carving
and gilding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The same method can be used on a ground of
dark red clay by the selection of colors which
will harmonize with the ground. Yellow flowers
look well upon a ground of this character, and
the yellow color can be produced, as we have said
before, by the use of yellow clay, either alone or
as an adjunct to the color.</p>

<p>Monochrome decorations can also be produced,
by the use of natural clays of various
colors, in the same manner as that pursued in the
use of the artificially tinted clay of which we
have been treating. Good effects can be produced
in this way, with the advantage that the
colors will be fully retained in the firing. Red, or
brown and white, in various degrees of combination,
can be used to produce a design with
every effect of light and shade. Also, red, with
cream-tinted clay, or the three colors—red, yellow
and white—can be used together. These
designs can be produced upon grounds of cream,
red, or yellow clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>


<h3>DRYING.</h3>

<p>When the painting has been completed, it
should dry very slowly, and it would be better,
if possible, to effect this by placing it in a moist,
cool place. It is, however, difficult to handle a
piece of ware when wet. The clay is in a very
soft state, and a sudden jar might cause the vase
to fall to pieces.</p>

<p>If the vase has not been in proper condition
for painting, or has dried too quickly, it will,
after some hours have elapsed, begin to show fine
cracks upon the surface of the painting. These
may be stopped, before they have gone too far,
by passing a modeling tool over them, or, if
the crack has become too deep for this treatment,
it may be filled with clay as nearly as possible in
the state at which the body of the ware has arrived.
If the cracks are allowed to go too far it
will be difficult to stop them, as they may have
extended into the body of the ware.</p>

<p>If the piece is permitted to go to the firing
with any cracks, however small upon its surface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
they will become widened in the firing, and,
especially after the glazing, will show very distinctly.</p>

<p>In the biscuit, they may be stopped by filling
them with powdered clay mixed with gum
water. But an ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure, and the safest method is to prevent
their appearance in the first place. If this
can not be done, they must be stopped as soon
as they appear. The finer clays seem to have
a greater tendency to crack in drying, and when
the cracks have appeared, they are more difficult
to stop than in other clays.</p>


<h3>FIRING.</h3>

<p>When the piece decorated is thoroughly dry,
it should be fired at a temperature sufficient to
make the body durable, and at the same time to
perfectly fix the colors of the painting, so that
there may be no danger that the glaze will cause
them to run in the final firing. This latter defect
may also result from an excess of glaze, and
where it exists only in a very slight degree, produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
a melting softness which is very pleasing.
This effect is, however, so likely to be exaggerated
to the ruin of the work that it is best not to run
any risk of the kind in firing, and to depend
upon the painting alone for the harmonious
blending of the tints.</p>

<p>The temperature at which the work is to be
fired, must, of course, depend upon the qualities
of the clay of which the piece of ware is made.
As has been said before, this clay should be one
that does not require an excessive degree of heat
in firing. The exact degree can be estimated by
the potter who understands the requirements of
the clay which has been used in the manufacture
of the particular piece of ware in question. It
may be said that the temperature at which Rockingham
ware is fired is suitable for this work,
and that a glaze such as that used upon that kind
of ware can be used with good results. It is
possible to have a glaze so adapted to the body
of the ware as to prevent it from crazing, and
yet preserve the brilliancy of the colors.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i066.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="drop-cap">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Under</span> this head may be
comprised the decorative
modeling of figures and
other designs upon pottery,
in various degrees
of relief. First, we have
figures in relief forming
decorations upon vases. These, as well as other
designs in high relief, belong properly to the
domain of sculpture, and the methods of producing
them do not vary essentially from those
in use in that art. The final process in this case
is the firing, instead of the casting in plaster and
cutting in marble.</p>

<p>Of the methods of producing floral designs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
relief, a few suggestions may be of use. These,
as well as the painting described in the previous
chapter, must be executed when the body of clay,
to which they are applied, is very wet, and the
applied clay must in this case be, as nearly as possible,
in the same condition. If the clay is not
in the proper condition, the work will crack in
drying.</p>

<p>The vase which is to be decorated being in the
right state, a lump of clay, having the plasticity
necessary for modeling, is procured. This may
be of C. C., a deeper cream color, or red, according
to the color desired. White granite is not
plastic enough, and is, besides, liable to crack in
drying. But of all white clays, parian forms
the most beautiful substance for this kind of
modeling. Leaves and petals of flowers can be
shaped from pieces of clay, which have been flattened
to the required thickness, either by pressing
upon a slab of plaster of paris, by means of
a weight, such as potters use; or, if the work is
not on a large scale, the clay can be shaped in
the palm of the hand. The forms can then be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
cut with a sharp modeling tool. If there
is more moisture in these pieces of clay than
in that which forms the body of the vase, they
should be allowed to remain a short time
upon a dry plaster slab. The plaster will
quickly absorb the moisture in the clay. When
ready, the pieces can be placed in position on
the vase, the places where they are to be applied
having been previously washed with clay and
water (technically called “slip”), or with glaze
water, to make them adhere. Stems are made by
rolling pieces of clay between the palms of the
hands, or upon a flat surface of wet plaster or
wood. They are afterwards allowed to dry, and
when in proper condition, applied in the same
manner as the flowers and leaves. Delicate touches
may be put in with a brush dipped in clay, of a
proper consistency for painting. The forms of
the design can be shaped and finished after they
have been applied to the vase by the use of modeling
tools, and, finally, with a camel’s-hair brush.
The design may also be brushed over with a sponge,
moistened with water, which will also be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
very useful in restoring the smooth surface of
the ground, if it has been injured in the process
of modeling.</p>

<p>After the modeling has been completed, the
work should be gone over with a modeling tool,
and in places where a mass of clay has been attached
to the surface, the edges should be under-cut.
This will prevent cracking. If this precaution
is not taken, a crack thus produced may
extend into the body of the vase and render it
unfit for firing. Where a large mass of clay occurs
in the modeled design, it is better to hollow
out the projection from the inside of the
vase, to prevent the cracking or warping of the
whole in firing, caused by the unequal thickness.</p>

<p>Cracks, which may appear in drying, should
be filled, or, if possible, be pressed out with a
modeling tool, before the piece is fired. If the
crack is so deep that it is necessary to fill it, the
place should be cut open with a modeling tool,
moistened with water, and filled with clay, as
nearly as possible in the same condition as that
upon the vase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Flowers can be modeled in parian clay upon
a creamy-tinted ground with good effect. Various
colors of deeper tinted natural clays, or clay
which has been artificially colored in the body,
can be used as the ground of such decorations.
Light grounds are sometimes colored after the
first firing, in the biscuit; or a ground can be
painted in the method described in the previous
chapter, while the vase is soft, and the modeled
decoration can then be applied instead of the
painting.</p>

<p>Decorations of this character in high relief
are frequently colored in natural tints, either under
the glaze, in the biscuit; or over the glaze.
The taste of this manner of finishing relief-work
is somewhat questionable, and the same objection
might apply to it as to colored sculpture.
That it has received the sanction of the best factories
in the world is no proof of its being in
accord with correct taste, as the many (artistic)
atrocities of Dresden and Capo di Monte testify.
Some of the later Haviland faience, however,
having a ground in the usual style of that ware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
with decoration in high relief, colored with subdued
tints, harmonizing with the grounds, is so
artistically done that one can hardly think it
open to this objection, although it can not be
considered an improvement upon the earlier
work of this establishment in which the colored
decorations were simply painted upon the surface.</p>

<p>It is only to the use of colors which imitate
those of nature upon modeled decorations that
there could be any objection. Relief-work may
be conventional in its form, or colored conventionally,
in one color or many, or gilded, with
perfect taste. The latter method produces a fine
effect, but, to make it successful, the color of
the ground should be well chosen, and the design
simple in form and not too much detached from
the surface. The gilding looks best when left
unburnished, and should only be rubbed enough
to give the effect of dead gold.</p>

<p>Next, we have applied designs in low relief.
These are made in several different ways, according
to the effects desired. Work of this kind is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
more commonly executed by the method used in
the production of Wedgwood-ware. The designs
to be applied are first modeled in clay. Casts
are then taken of the models in plaster of paris.
Clay of the kind desired for the relief designs is
then pressed in the mold and the edges trimmed
off. The design can be removed from the mold
by the aid of a flat, steel instrument, with a
short, broad blade; or a palette knife, which when
pressed upon the clay adheres to it and detaches
it from the mold. It can then be transferred to
the piece of ware to be decorated, to which it is
made to adhere by the use of “slip,” as described
before.</p>

<p>This method is very useful, indeed, indispensable
in the manufacture of such wares commercially,
when the same designs are to be repeated
many times, but it is hardly to be recommended
for artistic work, except for conventional designs,
borders, etc. This method of casting the forms
in a mold may be useful, however, in the reproduction
of leaves of intricate outline, which can
be made of various sizes, and, from the plasticity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of the clay, can be infinitely varied in position
according to the taste of the worker.</p>

<p>When objects of delicate and intricate form,
such as threads, spider’s webs, nets, and sometimes
leaves, are to be represented in work of this
character, it can be accomplished by dipping
threads, or nets of cotton, or, if leaves, the natural
leaves themselves, into “slip.” The clay
adheres to the threads, or forms, and after it has
set sufficiently, they can be placed upon the object
to be decorated. On firing, the substance
inclosed within the clay is dissipated and the clay
only, remains. Some very wonderful and beautiful
effects may be produced in this way; but,
as these delicate forms are necessarily very fragile,
especially if much detached from the surface,
they are only suitable for articles intended solely
for ornament.</p>

<p>Designs in low relief can also be applied with
the brush in the forms desired, which may afterward
be shaped and finished by the use of modeling
tools, or, when dry, carved with steel instruments.
This latter is said to be the method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
by which M. Solon executes his exquisite designs
in fine white clay upon ware which has been
colored in the body. One of the greatest beauties
of M. Solon’s work is the transparent
effect produced where the clay has been left so
thin as to show the colored ground through.</p>

<p>Work in the very slightest relief can be done
with the brush alone. Care must be observed
in this, however, that the application of clay is
not so very slight as to produce complete transparency
upon firing. By a judicious mixture
of work in which the clay is so heavily laid
on as to remain opaque after the firing, and of
that which is applied so thinly as to become
transparent, very delicate and beautiful effects
can be produced by the use of white clay upon
colored grounds.</p>

<p>The colored grounds in the Wedgwood and
Solon ware are produced by the use of a fine clay
body, which has been artificially colored throughout,
which, in the case of Wedgwood, is finished
by a very slight glaze, and in the Solon ware, by
a full glaze, by which the transparent effects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
certain parts of the work are brought out. The
colors used in the body of these wares are blues,
dark greens, and olives, and also black. Where
it is not possible for the amateur, for whom
these hints are written, to obtain such wares for
decoration, very pretty work can be produced, as
has been mentioned before, by the use of a body
of naturally colored clay upon which white or a
light-colored clay can be applied.</p>

<p>Relief-work can be finished with a full glaze, a
very slight glaze, or can be left unglazed. As a
general thing it may be said that the modeling
in a design in high relief will look best with but
a slight glaze, or none at all. The slight glaze
is called by potters a “smear” glaze, and is
effected by firing the work in a “seggar,” which
is glazed upon the inside. The unglazed ware absorbs
enough glaze from the glazed surface to give
it a semi-glazed appearance, which is very pleasing.
Work in partial relief, as well as articles in
full relief, can also be finished by the application
of colored glazes. This is the method by which
the ware known at the present time as majolica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
is produced. Blue and green glazes of this
kind are frequently to be obtained in potteries
in this country, where they may be applied to
work which has been modeled. Other colors in
majolica glazes are to be had from the dealers, and
if the colors desired can not be applied at the pottery,
the artist can apply them with a brush in
the same manner as paint is used upon the biscuit.
The effect of work of this kind can also
be enhanced by gilding put on over the glaze.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">These</span> are two of the simplest
as well as most effective
methods of decorating
pottery. We will treat
first of incised work in
clay.</p>

<p>The piece of ware to be decorated must, of
course, be in the “green” state; not too wet,
yet not dry enough to be brittle. An outline
drawing can then be executed upon its surface
with a pointed modeling tool, not too sharp, and
perfectly rounded at the point. If any burr is
thrown up in the course of the lines, it must not
be brushed off until the piece has become partially
dry. The drawing can then be brushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
over with a stiff camel’s-hair brush, leaving the
lines free. These lines can now be filled with
dark (under-glaze) paint (black is best), mixed
with a little gum arabic and water. In going
over the lines some of the paint will extend over
the edges; this can be scraped off, when the
clay is dry, with the edge of a sharp steel blade,
two or three inches long, held between the fingers
and thumb. A broken knife-blade will do
for the purpose. This scraping must be very
lightly and carefully done, to avoid injuring the
surface of the ware. The surface may afterwards
be rubbed over with the very finest sandpaper,
when entirely dry.</p>

<p>The finish of this work must not be a full
glaze, but the “smear” glaze, described in the
last chapter. A full glaze would fill up the lines,
and so injure the appearance of the work. In
order that the black lines may be effective, the
ground of the decoration should be rather light
in color. The best colors for the body of wares
to be decorated in this way are light cream color,
or a mixture of cream color and red clay, producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
a light brick-red; or, if they can be
procured, any light colored clays which have been
artificially tinted in the body. A colored ground
for this work can be procured by having the
piece of ware dipped in colored slips. The design
is then incised upon the surface, after it has
become dry enough, in the same manner as before.
The lines are cut through to the body
of the ware beneath, showing a color contrasting
with that upon the surface with good effect.
Work of this kind is also executed upon stoneware.
That of Miss Hannah Barlow will be
remembered as an instance of incised work,
in black lines, upon a red or light brown body.
Incised work also appears upon the Lambeth
stoneware. It is here used upon grey stoneware,
with raised dots in white, and colored with blue
glaze. Incised decorations can also be executed
upon earthenware in this way. White ware may
be used, and the design drawn upon it in the
“green” state. The piece may then be finished
with colored glaze, which sinks into the depressions
formed by the lines, and so gives them a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
darker color than the rest of the surface. Carved
work can also be introduced with good effect as
an accessory to incised work, and a few words as
to this kind of decoration will now be in place.</p>


<h3>CARVING IN CLAY.</h3>

<p>This work can be made very beautiful and
effective by those familiar with the use of carving
tools. The tools used should be short-handled
carving tools, and the ware should be in the
“green” state and as for incised work, neither
too wet nor too dry. Dry enough for clean cutting
with the tools, and yet not so dry as to be
brittle. When in just the right state, clay forms
a fine substance for carving. As it dries very
rapidly, means should be used to keep it sufficiently
moist until the work is finished.</p>

<p>The outline can be drawn upon the clay with
a sharp-pointed modeling tool, and the carving
can be executed with gouges, chisels, and parting
tools of the various shapes and sizes necessary.
Veining can be done with a pointed modeling
tool, and dots can be readily incised by pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
on the surface. Raised dots can be made with
softer clay which has been dipped up in a quill
of the required size, which is then pressed upon
the surface at the place where the dot is desired.</p>

<p>Carved work can be finished by the use of
sand paper, a camel’s hair brush, and water, or a
sponge; but these should not be used very freely,
as they will injure the sharpness and cleanness
of the cutting, which it is desirable to preserve.
Carving looks best when finished with a “smear”
glaze.</p>

<p>Another variety of carved work can be produced
upon a vase which has been previously
dipped in colored “slip.” The design is then
cut through the covering to the ground beneath,
which should be of a contrasting color.</p>

<p>Another method by which many varied and
beautiful effects can be produced is that of incising
lines, and cutting or pressing designs into the soft
clay, which are then filled with various colored slips.
The lines or other designs should be deeply cut,
moistened with water and filled with the colored
clays, which should be pressed into the depressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and allowed to dry. When dry, the surface
can be scraped in a similar manner to that
made use of in finishing incised work. It should
be noted that in this latter work the body of the
clay should be in a softer state than would be
necessary for other carved or incised work.</p>

<p>Carving in clay, as well as modeling and incising
can be glazed with the colored majolica
glazes with excellent effect.</p>

<span class="fs80">PAINTING UPON THE BISCUIT.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i083.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt="drop-cap">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> the ware has been fired
once and is in what is called
the “biscuit,” it can be decorated
by the use of underglaze
colors, in the form of thin
washes resembling water-color
painting. Ware used for this
purpose should be made of white, or very light
cream-colored clay, as the colors, being used in
transparent washes, would be dimmed, and would
have their tints sullied by use upon a ground of
dark color.</p>

<p>On white ware those colors should be used
which will best stand the heat necessary in the
firing and glazing of this ware. For this reason
painting executed on white is usually in monochrome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and only the strongest colors are used,
such as blue, black, or brown. The best effect is
produced by the use of blue. This style of work
is familiar from the numerous pieces of Japanese
ware, of porcelain or white earthen-ware, painted
in blue, which are brought to this country.</p>

<p>The method of painting is simple and not
likely to prove difficult or uncertain as to its results
in the hands of one familiar with the use of
water colors. The color generally used is dark
blue, and there are several different blues which
furnish very fine tints. Among these might be
mentioned Emery’s cobalt blue, which is excellent
and does very well upon the white ware manufactured
here. Phillips’ mazarine blue and Harrison’s
Persian blue are also very rich, deep colors,
the latter having a purplish tint. One of the
best blues, as reliable and pleasing in color as any,
has been prepared by Mr. Joseph Bailey, of the
Hamilton Road Pottery.</p>

<p>The color must be rubbed down until perfectly
smooth, and should be mixed with water and
enough gum arabic to keep it from rubbing off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
in the necessary handling before firing. The design
having been sketched upon the ware to be
decorated, with a lead pencil, the first washes may
be put in with a light tint of the blue. These
should be laid on with a free hand and without
retouching before they have dried. The darker
tints may then be laid in, and lastly the deepest
shadows. These should be painted thickly and
sharply to give the proper depth of color. If
necessary they may be painted over a second
time; care should be taken, however, not to
have an excess of paint in any part, as that would
prevent the glaze from adhering to the ware.
The lines should be particularly clear and sharp,
as they generally spread more or less in the glazing,
and if they are not well defined and the shadows
are not dark enough, the effect will be blurred
and indistinct. In this kind of work clearness
and distinctness are to be desired. If the painting
is carefully executed and the various degrees
of light and shade are well preserved, something
of the effect of a painting in water colors will be
produced. Monochromes in brown and black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
are done in the same way, only that in the case
of the latter color it is better to mix a very little
blue with it, as that will make it stand the fire
better. Before glazing, the ware should be fired
once to “harden on” the colors. If the color
should run in the glazing, the painting may be repaired
by the use of gilding over the glaze, by
which the blurred outlines may be concealed.
When, from the perfection of the firing, this is
unnecessary, work of this kind, and especially
that in blue, may be very much enhanced by a
judicious use of gilding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Painting in the Lambeth or Bennett Style.</span></h3>

<p>This is done upon a very light, cream-colored
ware. The method of painting is similar
to that described above, with the exception that
all colors can be used. In using the weaker
colors, and in mixtures, the same rules that have
been given before must be observed. Colors
which do not stand the fire very well, such as
yellow and rose color, must be laid on thickly,
while in mixtures, as well as when used alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the stronger colors should be used sparingly.
In the Lambeth or Bennett style of painting
upon faience, the designs are either wholly or
partly conventional. The grounds are either left
the natural color of the ware or painted. The
designs usually of flowers are in natural colors
very slightly shaded and surrounded by a dark
outline.</p>

<p>The design having been drawn upon the
surface with a lead pencil, the ground, if it is to
be colored, may be laid on with some color, or
mixture of colors, which will harmonize with the
decoration. As it is impossible to paint it
smoothly with a brush, or to do it by any of
the methods in use for over-glaze painting, the
ground must be “dabbled” on, either with a
small blending brush, or better, a sponge, which
has been cut to the proper shape and size, and
which may be fastened in a quill and used as a
brush. This is dipped in the color which has
been mixed upon the palette, and with it the
color is applied to the surface of the vase, producing
a mottled ground, which may be shaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
from light to dark, by the application of more
or less color, as desired, and also may be varied
by the introduction of other colors which will
harmonize with each other, and with the decoration.
The design may then be painted in flat
washes, which should be laid on freely, with the
shadows boldly defined. This done, a line,
either of black or dark olive green, made from
dark brown and a little green, may be painted
around the design, outlining and relieving it
against the ground.</p>

<p>The painting finished, the piece should then
be fired to fix the colors. If necessary, it can
be touched up in any places which are thought to
need deeper tints after this firing, and before the
final process of glazing. It must be remembered,
however, that the effect of the glazing will
be to deepen the colors, and, unless the result
of this process has been learned from experience,
the tendency will rather be to get them too
dark than too light. The most important thing
is, to keep the relative value of the lights and
shadows. If this is done, the effect will not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
bad, even if the colors should fade a little in
firing.</p>

<p>Another very important item in under-glaze
painting, which has been mentioned before, is,
that the colors must be in proper condition for
use, and to that end, must be carefully rubbed
down with a muller or palette knife. Inattention
to this detail has caused much work of
rude and rough appearance to be produced, which
might otherwise have been fairly good.</p>

<p>In the Lambeth and Bennett ware the charming
effect of color will generally be found to
have been produced by a system of burning
which would scarcely be considered legitimate,
according to the strict rules of the potter’s art.
The ware is not fired in the biscuit as hard as
such ware is usually fired, and the glaze applied
is softer than the body of the ware demands.
This soft glaze is used to save the colors, and
not being suited to the body of the ware will,
generally, be found to be badly crazed. In this
case, however, lovers of beautiful and harmonious
colors, in the decoration of pottery, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
think that the ends justifies the means, and as
the articles are wholly adapted for ornamental
purposes, this defect of glaze detracts but little
from their value.</p>

<p>Some work of a similar character has recently
been done in this city, however, in which the
ware has been fired and glazed in such a manner
as to make it perfectly durable, and, at the same
time, great beauty of coloring has been retained.
This result is not only important from the fact
that it offers opportunity for the production of
ornamental wares, but, also, from the consideration
that the perfection of the firing and glazing
of the ware renders it valuable for articles of use.
Nothing could be prettier than sets of tableware
made of this cream-tinted clay, decorated
in colored, conventional designs. This would,
we think, be the perfection of ware for ordinary
use, and would form, with the combination of
the delicately tinted body and the harmonious
colors of the underglaze decoration, a service
both pleasing to the eye and very durable.</p>

<p>It is not the province of a work on under-glaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
painting to enter into the subject of over-glaze
decoration, yet as they are frequently combined,
mention may be made of some of the
varieties of decoration in which the two processes
are used. The most common form of the union
of the two methods is that in which gilding is
used as an adjunct to under-glaze decoration.
Gold is always applied over the glaze, as it
would be utterly destroyed by the action of the
heat necessary in the firing of any hard glaze.
That prepared by decorators by dissolving gold
in aqua regia may be used, or the “bright”
gold, which is obtained in a liquid state. The
former is the most durable, and when fired can
be burnished or left with a dead finish, which in
many cases has the most pleasing effect. The
“bright” gold, as its name indicates, becomes
bright in the firing and the burnishing is thus
rendered unnecessary. On a “smear” glaze the
“bright” gold produces a beautiful dead gold
effect, owing to the dead surface of the ware to
which it is applied. In Japanese wares, dark
blue, under-glaze, often appears in conjunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
with gold, and also with red, green, or other
colors which have been put on over the glaze.</p>

<p>One beautiful result of the combination of
over and under-glaze painting is seen in the ware
painted by Lemonnier. In this the ground is
generally painted under the glaze in a manner
similar to that described in this chapter for the
production of Lambeth faience. The design is
then painted with over-glaze “relief” colors,
and the high lights laid in heavily, the whole producing
an effect which combines the delicacy of
the over-glaze colors with the depth of the
under-glaze.</p>

<p>We have tried to indicate, in the preceding
chapters, the principal methods employed in the
decoration of pottery under the glaze. These
various methods are combined with each other
and with over-glaze work in so many ways that
it is difficult for any but an expert to distinguish
in a given piece of ware the many processes
which may have combined to produce the result.
This renders the subject more difficult to treat
comprehensively, and these various ramifications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of the art of under-glaze painting can here be
but indicated. It is hoped, however, that the
suggestions given may be sufficient to afford the
student of ceramic decoration an idea of the
various forms and of the possibilities of the
art.</p><br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
